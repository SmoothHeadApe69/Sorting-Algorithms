Is a divide and conquer, recursive algorithm which involves choosing a pivot from the given elements in an array and partitioning the other elements into 2 sub-arrays, such that all values less than the pivot are placed to its left and those greater than it are placed to the right. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively until the entire array of items is sorted.

Space complexity: O(nlog(n)) 

Time complexity; Worst case: O(n^2)

Average case: O(nlog(n)) 

Best case: O(nlog(n)) 

Data structure: Array
