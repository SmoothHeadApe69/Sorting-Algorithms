Is stable an in-place comparison sorting algorithm, which sorts an array by first dividing it into 2 seperate ‘sub-arrays’, where the first value of the array(since it doesn’t have items to its left), is considered sorted. We index up the array and compare the [n-1] and [n] indexed values and swap them if needed, if not proceed until the entire array is sorted.

Space complexity: O(1) 

Time complexity; Worst case: O(n^2) 

Average case: O(n^2) 

Best case: O(n) Data structure: Arra
