The bubble sort is a comparison-sort algorithm, which sorts items in an array by repeatedly stepping through the array, comparing adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the incorrect order. The steps through the array are repeated until the array is sorted.

Space complexity: O(1)

Time complexity; Worst case: O (n^2) 

Average case: O(n^2)

Best case: O(n)

Data structure: Array
