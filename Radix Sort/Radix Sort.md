Is an algorithm that sorts the elements by first grouping the individual digits of same place value into a linked list. It then sorts the elements according to their increasing or decreasing order. It is only used to sort numbers.

Space complexity: O(n+2)^2 

Time complexity; Worst case: O(n * k/d) 

Average case: O(n * k/d) 

Best case : O(k(n+d))

Data structure: Array
