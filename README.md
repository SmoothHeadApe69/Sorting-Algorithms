#Sorting algorithms are used to rearrange a given array or list of elements according to a comparison operator on the elements.

Divide & conquer: A divide-and-conquer algorithm works by breaking down a problem into smaller sub-problems of the same or related type, until they become simple enough to solve directly.




Comparison sorting: It involves elements in the given array list being compared to each by an operator mainly > or < operators that determines which of the two elements should occur first in the final sorted list.




In-place sorting: An in-place algorithm is an algorithm that does not need extra space and produces an output in the same memory that contains the data by transforming the input ‘in-place’. However, a small constant extra space used for variables is allowed.




Recursive algorithm: Is an algorithm which calls itself with "smaller (or simpler)" input values, and which obtains the result for the current input by applying simple operations to the returned value for the smaller (or simpler) input.




Stable algorithm: An algorithm is stable if two objects with equal keys appear in the same order in sorted output as they appear in the input unsorted array.




Space complexity: Refers to the memory space on your device used to solve the algorithm.




Time complexity: It’s the amount of time it takes to run the algorithm.
