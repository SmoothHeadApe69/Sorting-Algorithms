Is a stable divide & conquer algorithm, which divides the unsorted array list into sublists each containing 1 element. The resulting adjacent pairs of elements are compared and merged recursively until the list is fully sorted.

Space complexity: O(n) 

Time complexity; Worst case: O(nlog(n)) 

Average case: O(nlog(n)) 

Best case: O(nlog(n))

Data structure: Array
