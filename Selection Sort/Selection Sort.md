Is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm,which sorts a given array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two sub-arrays at a given time. The sub-array which is already sorted(Initially empty) Remaining sub-array which is unsorted(Initially the entire input array)

Space complexity: O(1) 

Time complexity; Worst case: O(n^2) 

Average case: O(n^2) 

Best case: O(n^2) 

Data structure: Array
