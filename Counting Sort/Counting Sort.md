Is a stable algorithm that sorts the elements of an array by counting the number of occurrences of each unique element in the array. The counts are stored in an auxiliary array and the sorting is done by mapping the counts as an index of the auxiliary array.

Space complexity: O(n+k), where k is the number of possible values. 

Time complexity; Worst case: O(n+k) 

Average case: O(n+k)

Data structure: Array List
